This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# react_portfolio
https://emilyporterfieldtaylor.github.io/react_portfolio/

## Description  
This updated portfolio was created with React and Reactstrap. I kept it pretty simple for a minimalist feel. I will continue to use the second iteration of my portfolio just because I like the way it looks better. I tried to use Materialzize on this project as well but it didn't play with React as nicely as Reactstrap.
